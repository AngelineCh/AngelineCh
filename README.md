##### I am Angeline, a fresh software engineer, still learning a lot of new exciting and challenging things.


<p>I am always very enthusiastic when it comes to learning new things in technology, I 
am very quick to learn from new languages to new competencies and skills and I am 
looking for a working place where I can use this ability of mine. I strongly believe in 
continuous learning and education as it is a great way to always improve myself, my 
work and the environment around me. </p>

<p>I have been trained in Python through an intensive course as well as SQL and 
databases. In addition, I have very good problem solving skills and through years of 
working experience I always give great attention to detail and make sure my work is 
always delivered on time and as it should.</p>
